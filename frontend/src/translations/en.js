        <b>Introduction:</b></br></br>
        Liar's Dice is an exciting and strategic dice game that has been played for centuries.
        It involves bluffing, deduction, and a keen sense of probability.
        In this guide, we will walk you through the rules and steps to play Liar's Dice.
        </br></br>
        <b>Objective:</b></br>
        The objective of Liar's Dice is to be the last player with dice remaining.
        Players make bids on the total number of dice with a particular face value on the table, 
        and the bidding continues until someone challenges the previous bid, suspecting it to be a lie. The game is played with a set of five dice per player.
        </br></br>
        <b>Game Setup:</b></br>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Gather a group of at least two players, but the game is more enjoyable with four or more players.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Each player should have a cup or container to conceal their dice.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Decide on the starting player. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.</li>
        </ol>

       <ol type="1">
            <li>All players shake their dice in their cups, keeping them concealed from others.</li>
            </br>
            <li>The starting player makes a bid by announcing the quantity of a particular face value 
            they believe exists among all players' concealed dice. For example, a bid could be "three threes," 
            indicating that the player believes there are at least three dice showing a three on the table.</li>
            </br>
            <li>The next player in turn order can either increase the quantity of the same face value or 
            challenge the previous bid. If they wish to challenge, they announce "liar."</li>
            </br>
            <li>If the bid is challenged, all players reveal their dice. If the total quantity of 
            the bid's face value is equal to or greater than the bid, the bidder wins, and the challenger 
            loses a die. Otherwise, the challenger wins, and the bidder loses a die.</li>
            </br>
            <li>The player who lost a die starts the next round. If multiple players lose a die, 
            the player next in turn order starts.</li>
            </br>
            <li>The game continues with players making bids, increasing the quantity or challenging, 
            until only one player remains with dice. That player is declared the winner.</li>
       </ol>

    "modal_how_to_play_title_3": "Rules for Bidding:",
    "modal_how_to_play_html_content_3": `
        <ol type="1">
            <li>The face value of a bid must be higher than the previous bid, or the bid can increase the quantity of the same face value.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Players can bid on any face value, including face value of the dice that have been revealed.</li>
            </br>
            <li>The face value of "ones" is considered the highest, followed by "sixes," "fives," and so on, in descending order.</li>
        </ol>
        </br>
        <b>Bluffing and Deduction:</b>
        </br></br>
        Liar's Dice involves bluffing and deduction, as players can choose to make bids that are not entirely truthful.
        </br></br>
        Players must carefully observe previous bids, calculate probabilities, and assess the likelihood of the bid being accurate.
        </br></br>
        Bluffing can be a valuable strategy to deceive opponents or force them into challenging bids that may be truthful.

            <li>Keep track of the number of dice remaining in the game and adjust your bids accordingly.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Bluff strategically, but be mindful of your opponents' bids and reactions.</li>
